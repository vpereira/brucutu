Brucutu - The bruteforce tool with the coolest test suite

Old problem, new tool. Trying to start a Pet project, basically because even
if I'm used with, hydra is too 90s for me. Basically I think the CLI is ugly
(as normally it was in the 90s) and the feature set, small.

Usage: ./brucutu -h

The flags are some how compatible with hydra, but I kind of give up of that.


TODO:
    - Better restore option
    - Heuristic switching among protocols to evade monitoring systems
    - output file
    - parallelism 
    - quiet mode
    - native support to tor with some advanced features
    - add more protocols
    - connect to graphite and maybe grafana to better monitoring
